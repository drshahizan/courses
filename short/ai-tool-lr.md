# AI Tools for Literature Review Course

## Course Overview
Literature reviews are an essential part of academic research. They allow researchers to gather and synthesize information from previous studies, identify gaps in the literature, and develop new research questions.

Traditionally, literature reviews have been conducted manually. Researchers would search for relevant articles in academic databases, read them carefully, and take notes. This process can be time-consuming and tedious.

In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has been used to automate some of the tasks involved in literature reviews. AI tools can be used to search for relevant articles, summarize the content of articles, and identify relationships between articles.
This modules provides an overview of the use of AI tools for literature reviews. It covers the following topics:
- The benefits of using AI tools for literature reviews
- The different types of AI tools available
- How to use AI tools to conduct literature reviews
- The limitations of AI tools for literature reviews

The modules is intended for researchers who are interested in learning more about the use of AI tools for literature reviews. It will also be of interest to librarians and information scientists who are involved in the development and evaluation of AI tools for research.This book will teach you the basics using AI tools for Literature Review.

## Course Objectives
By the end of this course, participants will be able to:

1. Understand the fundamentals of AI and its applications in literature review.
2. Utilize AI tools for paper search to efficiently find relevant research papers.
3. Explore AI tools for paper discovery to identify related articles and scholarly connections.
4. Apply AI tools for paper visualization to understand the relationships between research papers.
5. Utilize AI-powered chatbots and assistance tools to enhance the literature review process.
6. Evaluate the suitability and reliability of AI-generated results in literature review.
7. Incorporate ethical considerations when using AI tools for literature review.
